# Capstone Project
Authors: Samuel Theising, JT Wellspring, and Nassim Zerroua.

Will be following the footsteps of Prof. Chowdhury and testing a Mutual Learning Algorithm.
### How to run the program
Must download python. We are using 3.12.5 to run and implement our own version of the project. To view:
```
python -- version
```
We used a built in library to tokenize the data. spaCy install:
```
pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
pip install -U spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```
As well as the use of Pandas:
```
pip install pandas
